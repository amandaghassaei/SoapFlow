# SoapFlow

This repo is a work in progress.
I'm hoping to build a fluid simulation of a 2D soap film - so far I've posted some info about computing a color lookup table for thin film interference.
I'm currently working on a WebGL implementation of [Efficient and Conservative Fluids Using Bidirectional Mapping](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cffjiang/research/qu2019advection/qu2019advection.pdf) as the methods of Stam's [Stable Fluids](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/frey/cours/references/Stam%20J.,%20Stable%20fluids.pdf) have too much numerical dissipation for this type of system.
